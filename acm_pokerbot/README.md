# PokerBot

## ðŸ¤– How to Build Your Own Strategy

1. Clone the [Poker Table system](https://github.com/SpaceRage/node-poker-app) here and set it up (instructions provided on that repo).
2. Clone this repository.

### Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd pokerbot
```

3. Run an example bot using the strategy provided (`example_strat_1.py`). All you have to do for this have 
   two or more team members run `main.py` and connect to server provided (edit server and port details in a ``.env`` file).
   (Or you can run multiple bots in different terminals.)
4. Once you understand how the game proceeds, look at `example_strat_2.py` for a very bare bones approach of how you can
    think about making a Poker bot that thinks algorithmically. Change line 21 in ``main.py`` to use ``example_strat_2`` instead.
5. Once you understand this, you can proceed to ``example_strat_3.py`` which is a little more complicated but nothing too crazy.
6. If you have any questions, reach out to any organizing members walking around. Good luck!
